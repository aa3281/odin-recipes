		<h1>Bohemian Orange Chicken</h1>
		<img src="../img/bohemian-orange-chicken.jpeg" alt="Bohemian Orange Chicken">
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>This Eastern European comfort food dish was inspired by two duck recipes: duck à l'Orange and a Bohemian-style roasted duck. The caraway-scented sweet and sour orange sauce works really well with chicken. Serve on top of traditional Czech bread dumplings alongside sautéed cabbage. Adapted from a recipe by Andrew Zimmern.</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>8 (5 ounce) bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs</li>
			<li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
			<li>½ cup diced onion</li>
			<li>1 pinch kosher salt</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
			<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
			<li>1 medium orange, zested</li>
			<li>⅔ cup freshly squeezed orange juice</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
			<li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
			<li>1 pinch ground cinnamon</li>
			<li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
			<li>⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon caraway seeds</li>
			<li>1 splash water, or as needed (Optional)</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon grated orange zest </li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Generously season chicken thighs on both sides with 2 teaspoons kosher salt.</li>
			<li>Heat olive oil in a large cast iron skillet over high heat. Add chicken, skin-side down, to the hot oil and sear until skin is golden brown and releases from the bottom of the skillet, 4 to 5 minutes. Turn and sear on the other side for 3 to 4 minutes. Turn off the heat and remove chicken to a plate. Drain fat from the skillet and reserve for another use.</li>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
			<li>Place the skillet back on the stove. Add onion, a pinch of kosher salt, and sugar. Turn heat to medium-high; cook and stir until onion turns translucent and sugar starts to caramelize on the bottom, 3 to 4 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds, being careful not to burn.</li>
			<li>Add orange zest, orange juice, lemon juice, and chicken broth. Increase heat to high, and stir in cinnamon, cayenne, and black pepper. Stir occasionally and bring to a boil. Boil until liquids are reduced by half, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
			<li>Turn off the heat and transfer chicken and any accumulated juices back into the skillet; make sure the skin is facing up. Baste chicken with the liquid and sprinkle caraway seeds over top.</li>
			<li>Cover and bake in the center of the preheated oven for 1 hour. Remove from the oven, remove the lid, and baste chicken.</li>
			<li>Return to the oven and bake, uncovered, until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 20 more minutes, adding a splash of water if the liquid dries out. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
			<li>Remove from the oven and baste again. Garnish with grated orange zest and serve.</li>
		</ol>
		<h2>Chef's Note</h2>
		<p>Use the fat from searing the chicken to sauté cabbage or to make dumplings.</p>
